title: "P-value statistics for multiple hypothesis testing of discrete
data models"
collection: talks
type: "Talk"
excerpt: 'Conservativeness of a p-value can occur if the test statistic from which it is derived is discrete,
or if the true parameter value under the null is not an LFC (least favorable parameter configuration).
We present a single- and two-stage ran- domized p-value to deal with these two sources
of conservativeness. We illustrate their effectiveness for testing a composite null hypothesis
under a binomial model. We also extend our p-values to equivalence tests frequently used in
”bioquivalence studies“ for establishing practical equivalence rather than the usual statistical
significant difference. Compared to non-randomized p-values, the resulting ran- domized pvalues
are less conservative under the null hypothesis and less powerful under the alternative
hypothesis. We also conduct the equivalence tests using a Bayesian procedure by computing
the posterior probability that the null hypoth- esis is true. Since the posterior probabilities are
uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, they can be used in place of the frequentist
p-value with a TOST procedure to conduct equivalence tests. This procedure is also preferred
since it leads to reduced sample sizes or more powerful tests than the TOST procedure when
used with the frequentist p-value. The behavior of the power function for the tests based on
the proposed p-values and posterior probabilities as a func- tion of the sample size is also
investigated. We evaluate the performance of the p-values in estimating the proportion of true
null hypotheses in multiple test- ing. The various claims in this research are verified using a
simulation study and real-world data analysis.
