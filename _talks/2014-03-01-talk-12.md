In this article, we consider single-and two-stage randomized p-values for testing composite
null hypothesis in discrete models. In particular, we investigate by use of mathematical
proofs if these p-values are (i) stochastically ordered in $c\in (0, 1]$, or c∗
, which is a support point for the LFC based p-value. We also prove (ii) if the p-values are strictly increasing with an increase in the sample size and if (iii) they are uniformly conservative. An analysis of the behavior of the CDF of the p-values under the alternative hypothesis for different
values of θ is also considered. It is shown that it is possible for the CDF of the single-stage
randomized p-value in the alternative hypothesis to exceed the CDF of the LFC-based pvalue. The CDF of the two-stage randomized p-value, on the other hand, can never coincide
with the one for the UMP p-value. A detailed analysis of the bias and mean square error
(MSE) of the Schweder–Spjøtvoll estimator is considered. The MSE is considered for the
case when the p-values are assumed to be independent and for the case when dependence
is assumed to exist. Values of c that minimize the bias and MSE are also found.
